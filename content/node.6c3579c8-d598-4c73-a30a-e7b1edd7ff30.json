It offers <em>amazing<\/em> content management, a library of pre-built functionality (modules), accessibility and responsiveness handled for you, and plenty more features. But then I learned about a module called <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/tome\" target=\"_blank\">Tome<\/a>, which allows a user to build their site in Drupal, and then export it to a static site, which could be easily hosted directly on Github.com.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>For the last piece of my puzzle, I was in search of a fast and lightweight local environment, which would essentially function as \"production\" for me, that could be simply plugged into a DevOps pipeline, likely to be Github Actions. I was hearing increasingly more about <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/lando.dev\" target=\"_blank\">Lando<\/a>, growing every year in popularity, and we just decided to adopt the tool at work. I've had the pleasure of working with Mike (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/pirog\" target=\"_blank\">@pirog<\/a>) and Alec (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/reynoldsalec\" target=\"_blank\">@reynoldsalec<\/a>) from the Lando team, and finally gave the tool a try. <\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>So I'm going with Drupal, Tome, Lando, Github, and a suite of other tools to bring this site to life.
